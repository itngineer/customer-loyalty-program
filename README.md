# Coding task

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

Submission Checklist:

- Follow standard best practices for structuring the code.
- Prepare and provide Test Data along with the code.
- Both positive and negative unit test cases for all operations – to be run as part of the build process.
- Implement RestAPI’s for all CRUD operations – in this case – creating/updating transactions, calculating and providing reward information for a User. (Java Backend/Full Stack)
- Consistent error handling and reporting of all failures including unexpected error conditions
- Use of appropriate logging levels, framework
- Reward calculation logic should be accurate
- Readme file is mandatory – must contain the steps required to build and run/test the code
- The solution must be checked into Github (provide a public github url)



### Java Backend :

    -OOPs concepts as much as possible when designing classes.
    -Swagger/OpenAPI (Optional) - helps communicate the contract in a better way
    -Document all response codes expected. The REST API should be sending the appropriate code and not 200 always.
    -Functional Programming constructs of Java 8 as appropriate.
    -Generic exception handler for un-anticipated exceptions.
